        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>The first thing I would like you to know is that I am an avid reader. My idea of a relaxing time is settling down and losing myself
            in a good book. I read novels as a way to relax as well as engage my mental faculties especially with engaging genres like mystery, 
            drama and thrillers. Some of my favorite authors are Agatha Christie for her Hercule Poirot books, Stephen King for all his horrors 
            that had me on teh edge of my seat, Lee Child for his action packed Jack Reacher series.

            I also enjoy games like Ludo and chess, but most of the time me playing games usually involves having a controller in my hand. It was
            my fascination with mobile and online games that prompted me on the the direction of technonlogical studies and software. 
            I went on to study Software Engineering where I found that i wasn't just game but even the internet is an amazing creation 
            when i understood how it worked. So I decided I would get to work closely with it and studied to become a web developer.
